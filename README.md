# The Beer-Book
A way for a brewer to keep a log of all of their brewing recipes in one place.

## Usage
The idea and purpose of the app is for a user to create a profile and then have the ability to keep all of their beer recipes in one place.
To use this app first clone into it and start both the frontend and backend servers.

##Installation

# Backend:
cd into the backend, run 'bundle install', 'rails db:create 'rails db:migrate', 'rails db:seed', and start the server with 'rails s'.

# Frontend:
Frontend link: https://github.com/Thomas-Muscarello/beer-book-frontend
cd into the frontend, run 'npm install' and 'npm start'. Please use Chrome as your browser.

## Contributing
Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/Thomas-Muscarello/beer-book-project.. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the code of conduct.

##Future Plan
Moving forward, I can see this app begin to have many different functions such as being able to update a recipe rather than deleting it, or saving a copy of an edited recipe. I also can see this app having a netwroking feature so that brewers can connect with eachother, and even try out other recipes. I can also see a text box being added so that directions to a brew can be added to each recipe.

## License
The app is available as open source under the terms of the MIT License. https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
